The M-40 was previously opened and brought on, then shut-in. (Under a seperate APM, WAR, etc.) The M-50 was opened and began producing the M-50, with the M-40, on 7/18/16. 

The M40 was previously brought on 10/20/15 at 1,900 bopd (seperate APM/WAR), but after 3 days of steady production the PI began to drop from an initial 4 bopd/psi to 1.0 bopd/psi. The well was shut in 10/27/15 to establish a new SITP and analyze the PI decline, but from that point forward the well performance indicates that the A3 tubing is fully obstructed between the tubing pressure gauge and the M40 reservoir. Shakeouts after 10/21/15 showed 0% water in the A-3 production fluid. 

Slickline was mobilized 1/3/16 and tagged at 1,015' SLM. Sample bailer beat down to 1,157', but failed to grab sample. Dump bailed 4x 2.5 gallons of xylene, moving tag depth down to 1,203' SLM. RIH with sample bailer, grabbed sample at 1,312' SLM, discovered hydrate in sample bailer. Began pumping glycol into well with slickline test pump, alternating between pumping, bleeding, RIH with sample bailer to agitate and beat on plug, and dump bailing glycol. Over 7 day period got down to 3,240' SLM, then demobed slickline once progress stagnated. (Previous APM/WAR.)

Coil tubing was mobilized 2/28/16, and had successfully washed through the hydrate by 3/6/16. The M40 has been on production since 3/6/16, and was depleted to an estimated shut in bottom hole pressure of 5,952 psi at the DHPG, which is within 200 psi of the M50 SIBHP @ DHPG (5,854 psi). The down hole pressure gage (DHPG) has been providing unreliable data since 10/14, so all current pressure analysis has been based on the A3 Tubing Pressure (TP) gauge. (Previous APM/WAR.)

Slickline mobilized 4/6/16 to open the upper M50 sleeve and commingle production with the M40. During initial 2.25"" gauge ring run, sat down at 9,751'.  RIH with 1.843"" swedge and spang jars to try and clear blockage and recovered white rubbery substance on tools.  RIH with sample bailer to work the obstruction and while pulling out of the hole, slickline operator closed crown valve before tools were in lubricator, leaving 50' of wire and tool string. RIH with blind box to break wire off rope socket and tool string. RIH with wire grab but did not recover any wire. Forced to RDMO wireline equipment due to SIMOPS. (Previous APM/WAR.)

The objective for this operation was to mobilize wireline to fish wire and tool string, clear the blockage at 9,751' and then open the Upper M50 sleeve to commingle the M40 and M50 reservoirs and bring them on production together. ",NO,NO,NO,,,,,
