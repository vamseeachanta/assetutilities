          has been shut in since 1997 due to water loading issues and it will not
          flow.

Proposal:  T&A wellbore.

Proposed Procedure:

1.	Test all casing annuli to 3-ppg EMW over the leakoff tests that were 
        performed during the drilling of the well.

CHANGE IN PLAN 2
  A)  The leakoff tests that were performed at the 13 3/8"" shoe and 9 5/8"" shoes 
      are unkown in our records and it is unknown what fluid type is in the 
      casing annuli's.
      The following tests were performed using 8.6 ppg fluid.
        13 3/8"" X 9 5/8"" was tested to 600 psi - good test.
          The 13 3/8"" X 20 annuli was not tested because there is not a wellhead 
          on the 20"" Drive Pipe nor are there any valves to tie into.
  B)  Continued with step 2 below.

2.	MIRU slickline unit.  NU and test BOPs and lubricator to 250/1,600-psi.  
        RIH and pull 'DX' plug at 635-ft MD.  ND BOPs and lubricator assembly. RD
        slickline.

3.	MIRU cementing unit.  Establish injection into the LL-6 with 6% KCl.

4.	Bullhead +/- 10-bbls cement and squeeze the existing perfs.  WOC.  
        Pressure test tbg and cmt squeeze to 1,000-psi.  Estimated TOC @ 10661' 
        MD.

CHANGE IN PLAN 1

  Current:  Unable to inject into the perforations at 4000 psi.

  Proposed Change in Plan 1

    A)  Perforate the tubing at 10900' MD and place a 250' cement plug and 
        horsecollar from 10900' to 10650'.  Test both sides of the plug to 1000 
        psi.
    B)  Continue as approved with step 5 below.

5.	RU slickline and test BOPs and lubricator to 250/500-psi (MASIP at 
        this point is 0-psi because the perforations are isolated).  RIH and 
        shoot circulating holes in the 3-1/2"" tbg at +/- 7,250-ft MD.

6.	MIRU cementing unit.  Establish circulation down tbg and up the annulus. 
        Spot 500-ft cmt horse collar from +/- 6,750 - 7,250-ft MD.  WOC.

        cutter and cut tbg at +/- 3,200-ft MD.  Pressure test cement horse collar
        by pressuring up on tbg to 1,000-psi.

8.	MIRU Pride 14.  Fill well as needed with completion fluid.  Install BPV.
        ND tree and NU BOPs.  Pull BPV and install two way check valve.  Pressure 
        test BOPs to 250/500-psi.  (MASIP is 0 psi at this point because the 
        perforations are isolated with cement and there is a 500' cement plug / 
        horsecollar from 7250' to 6750' MD.  These plugs have been tested to 1000
        psi.).
          Note:  Because this is a workover, the BOP's and associated equipment 
                 will be tested within 7 day intervals per 30CFR250.616.

9.	POOH with 3-1/2"" tbg string.

10.	RU slickline and test BOPs and lubricator to 250/500-psi.  RIH with jet 
        cutter and cut 9-5/8"" csg at +/- 3,050-ft MD.  POOH cutter.  RD slickline.

11.	PU and RIH with workstring down to +/- 3,050-ft MD.  

12.	MIRU cementing unit.  Try to establish circulation down tbg and up 
        surface x prod csg annulus.  

13.	If able to circulate, place 250-ft cement horse collar from +/- 2,800 -

        3,050-ft MD and squeeze circulating holes to 1,000-psi.  WOC.  Pressure 
        test cement plug to 1,000-psi.

CHANGE IN PLAN 2
       A)  Tested the 13 3/8"" X 9 5/8"" casing annuli to 1500 psi - good test. 
       B)  Continue with step 14 below.

14.	POOH with workstring.  RU slickline and test BOPs and lubricator to 
        250/500-psi.  RIH and shoot circulation holes in 9-5/8"" csg at +/- 475-ft

            is lower than anticipated.

  Proposal:
            A)  Perforate the 9 5/8"" casing at 283' MD (Where TOC was tagged).
            B)  Pump a 100' cement plug from 283' to 183' MD. 
            C)  Test plug on both sides to 1000 psi.
            D)  Continue with approved permit below.

          Note:  Because this is a workover, the BOP's and associated equipment 
                 will be tested within 7 day intervals per 30CFR250.616.

CHANGE IN PLAN 2

  Current:  Performed the cement horsecollar as written in step 16 we are unable 
            to obtain good pressure tests on the 9 5/8"" casing and the 9 5/8"" X 
            13 3/8"" casing anulus.  The cement plug was tagged at 283' MD which 
            is lower than anticipated.

  Proposal:
            A)  Perforate the 9 5/8"" casing at 283' MD (Where TOC was tagged).
            B)  Pump a 100' cement plug from 283' to 183' MD. 
            C)  Test plug on both sides to 1000 psi.
            D)  Continue with approved permit below.

            to 26' BML.  The plug was tagged at 26' BML.  We obtained a good 1000
            psi test on the 9 5/8"" casing but the 13 3/8"" X 9 5/8"" casing annulus
            will not test.

  Proposal: 
            A)  Cut the 9 5/8"" casing at 15' BML.
            B)  ND BOP & 9 5/8"" wellhead.  SEE DEPARTURE REQUEST.
            C)  Pull the 9 5/8"" casing from 15' BML.
            D)  Determine the mechanical integrity of the 13 3/8"" casing with a 
                packer from the mudline to the cement plug at 26' BML.
            E)  If test is good,
              a) Recover packer.
              b) NU dry hole tree.
                   Note:  Will not be able to test the dry hole tree as approved
                          because of the leak in the 13 3/8"" casing. 
              c) Continue as permitted with step 18 below.

  Proposal:

            A)  Mechanically cut the 9 5/8"" casing at 88' MD / 63' AML.
            B)  Pull the 9 5/8"" casing from 88' MD / 63' AML.
            C)  Set 13 3/8"" packer above stub at 88' MD / 63' AML and test the 
                casing from the packer down to the cement plug at 26' BML to 1000
                psi. and monitor for 15 minutes.

          perforations from 11200' to 11224' MD / 7290' to 7304' TVD.  This well 
          has been shut in since 1997 due to water loading issues and it will not
          flow.

Proposal:  T&A wellbore.

Proposed Procedure:

1.	Test all casing annuli to 3-ppg EMW over the leakoff tests that were 
        performed during the drilling of the well.

CHANGE IN PLAN 2
  A)  The leakoff tests that were performed at the 13 3/8"" shoe and 9 5/8"" shoes 
      are unkown in our records and it is unknown what fluid type is in the 
      casing annuli's.
      The following tests were performed using 8.6 ppg fluid.
        13 3/8"" X 9 5/8"" was tested to 600 psi - good test.
          The 13 3/8"" X 20 annuli was not tested because there is not a wellhead 
          on the 20"" Drive Pipe nor are there any valves to tie into.
