CSV vs. HDF5

CSV is a simple format that is easy to read and write. It is also easy to import into many software packages. However, it is not very efficient for large datasets. HDF5 is a more complex format that is more efficient for large datasets. It is also more flexible, allowing you to store multiple datasets in a single file. However, it is not as easy to read and write as CSV.
