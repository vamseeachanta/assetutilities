Damn - This Hedge Fund prototype is entirely run by AI Agents and is capable of making profitable trades!

It is run by 6 AI Agents - 

1. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals

2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals (also has access to News)

3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals

4. Technical Analyst - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals

5. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits

6. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

This system has great potential - No wonder why Wall Street banks are expected to cut up to 200K jobs over the next three to five years.
