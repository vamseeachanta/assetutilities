1. Copy the "git-update-feature-branches" to your local folder, e.g. "c:\bash"
2. Add the following folders to the "Path" environment variable
   - your installed Git's bin folder. This is where it locates on my box: "C:\Users\tranq\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\bin"
   - the bash script folder you've just copied the file to, e.g. "c:\bash"
3. Then, run the following command from your favorite command prompt to update your feature branches.
   git update-feature-branches
