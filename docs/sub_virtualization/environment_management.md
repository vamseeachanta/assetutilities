## Introduction

## Summary

Key aspects to consider are:
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensuring that each environment is isolated to prevent conflicts between dependencies.
- **Reproducibility**: Environments should be reproducible to ensure consistent behavior across different setups.
- **Ease of Use**: The management tools should be user-friendly and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
- **Upgrade**: dependabot, PyUp, Renovate, pip-tools, Snyx, etc.
- **Security**: Regular updates and security patches should be applied to the environments.
  - vulnerability scanning tool for your dependencies? (eg. Safety, pip-audit, Bandit, Snyx, Trivy, GitLab Dependency Scanning, PyUp, OWASP, Jake, Mend, etc)

Package maintenance

- domain or adjacent community standards that your package aims to comply with? (eg. HIPAA, W3C, etc)
