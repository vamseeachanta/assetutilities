## brief and problem statement 

how do we convert proprietary math CAD files into text files is a problem statement.

### context 
- Andy is a consultant
- he needs to be able to integrate his code with existing math CAD applications
- the mathcad engine takes mathcad files as inputs
- these inputs files are binary files. they contain 
	- the problem statement/description
	- the data might be hardcoded or sourced from external files
	- the algorithm to solve the problem/problem statement
- since these input files are binary, only mathcad can open them
- mathcad does not have much automation tools, versioning and so on. managing these files can get very clunky. also the users might not be and also might not have an incentive to automate their workflows. 

### problem 
- if andy joins as a new consultant is given a mathcad input file and he needs to make sense of what it is doing,
	- what is the engineering / math problem being modeled in this file
	- what are the inputs and how are they being populated ? (hardcoded or sourced from external data sources)
	- what is the algo ? what math calculations is it doing 
	- convert all of this into a text pseudo code + map to some kind of a diagram so it is easy to figure what is actually going on 
	- conver this into some other language (e.g. python )
- why is the python code important 
	- as a consultant if andy has to create some code that integrates with an existing mathcad module, running integration tests are probably laborius
		- e.g. run andy's code, spit it to a text file, manually run the math code model, validate the output of math cad matches the expected results. make sure the end to end analysis is accurate
		- if the math cad model to "validate" andy's output is simple, we have to keep validating and running checks again and again
		- 1 option is known inputs and outputs and stub out simple validations. 
		- would be great if we have a parallel model in python that ends up porting the mathcad algo into python to make end to end analysis and engineering validation much easier 

## experiments 

uploaded file to chatgpt and played with it. 

take aways :
- mcdx is a binary archive format 
- 7zip extracted the entire the archive
- chatgpt can understand worksheet.xml
- it is able to identify data blocks and calculation/function blocks
- it is able to convert those function blocks to python code as well

open questions :
 - [ ] figure out more about the format of the mcdx 
	 - [ ] map the purpose of each file in the archive
	 - [ ] identify the model, algo, data etc 
	 - [ ] if algo, identify the specific function blocks (xml tags marking out the exact function blocks)
### transcript 
played with chatgpt to make sense of this. full transcript below. my queries are in italics 

*hey chat gpt can you help me understand the contents of a file that is binary formatted ?*

```
Yes, I can help with that. Please upload the binary file, and I'll analyze its contents for you.
```

*Visualisation of Typical Wellbore Surve*

```
The file you uploaded has a `.mcdx` extension, which typically indicates that it's a Mathcad Prime document. Mathcad is used for engineering calculations, and the Prime version uses this specific format.

To understand the contents, I'll need to convert or extract the data from this file format. Let's start by inspecting the raw contents to determine the best approach. I'll read and display the first few bytes of the file to get a sense of its structure.

The file starts with `PK`, which indicates that it is a ZIP archive. This is common for many document formats, including Mathcad Prime files, which bundle their contents in a compressed archive.

We can unzip the file and examine its contents to understand the data inside. Let's proceed with extracting the archive.

The extracted contents of the `.mcdx` file include several directories and files:

1. `mathcad`
2. `_rels`
3. `[Content_Types].xml`
4. `docProps`

The main document data is likely within the `mathcad` directory. Let's explore its contents to find the worksheet or other relevant files.

The `mathcad` directory contains several files and subdirectories:

1. `worksheet.xml`
2. `excel`
3. `_rels`
4. `header.xml`
5. `media`
6. `footer.xml`
7. `settings`
8. `result.xml`
9. `integration.xml`

The primary data and calculations are most likely in `worksheet.xml`. Let's start by inspecting the contents of `worksheet.xml`.

It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, I can guide you on how to manually inspect the contents of the `worksheet.xml` file or any other files within the extracted directories. You can open `worksheet.xml` with any text editor (like Notepad++ or VSCode) to view its structure and contents. This file should contain the main data and calculations from your Mathcad document. If you need further assistance with specific parts of the file, feel free to ask!
```

*thank you.. 1. please print worksheet.xml 2. what unzipping algorithm was used to unpack this file ?*

```
1. Here's how you can manually open and view the `worksheet.xml` file:

   - Navigate to the extracted directory (`/mnt/data/extracted_mcdx/mathcad/worksheet.xml`).
   - Open the `worksheet.xml` file with a text editor like Notepad++, VSCode, or any XML viewer. This will allow you to see the entire content of the file.

2. The unzipping algorithm used to unpack the `.mcdx` file is ZIP, which is a common compression format used for bundling files. Most unzipping tools, such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or the built-in unzip utilities in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, can handle ZIP archives. 

If you need more specific guidance or assistance with the contents of the `worksheet.xml` file, feel free to let me know!
```

*worksheet.xml* [worksheet](worksheet.xml)
*can you make sense of this ?*

```
The `worksheet.xml` file appears to be a Mathcad worksheet saved in XML format. Here's a summary of its content based on the snippet provided:

1. **Regions**:
   - The worksheet consists of multiple regions, each identified by a `region-id`. These regions contain different types of content, including text and mathematical expressions.

2. **Text Regions**:
   - Text regions are formatted using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) and include paragraphs with styled text. For example, the first region contains the title "Visualisation of typical Wellbore survey data in Mathcad."

3. **Math Regions**:
   - Mathematical regions define variables and perform calculations. For example:
     - `ORIGIN` is defined as 0.
     - `data` is defined as a matrix extracted from an Excel component.
     - Variables like `depth`, `inc`, and `Azimuth` are defined using matrix columns from `data`.

4. **Excel Component**:
   - The worksheet includes an embedded Excel component. The data from this Excel component is imported and used in calculations within Mathcad.

5. **Functions**:
   - The worksheet defines functions for specific calculations. For example:
     - `dist` calculates distances based on inclination and depth data.
     - `x` and `y` functions calculate x and y distances traveled based on azimuth, inclination, and depth data.

6. **Formatting**:
   - The text and math regions use various formatting options, such as font family, style, size, and color. The document includes instructions and comments within text regions.

To further assist you, here's the `worksheet.xml` content in a readable format:

This snippet gives an idea of how the document is structured. The XML tags and attributes describe the layout and content of the worksheet, including text formatting and mathematical definitions.

If you need more specific information or have further questions about this file, feel free to ask!
```

*does this file have sample data in it ? can you show that data ?*

```
Yes, the file contains data related to the wellbore survey. Based on the contents of the `worksheet.xml` file, the data is imported from an Excel component and used in various calculations.

Let's find and extract the actual sample data from the `worksheet.xml` file. I'll search for the relevant portions of the file where the data might be defined.

It seems like I canâ€™t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, you can manually check for sample data in the `worksheet.xml` file by searching for tags like `<ws:matrix>`, `<ws:vector>`, or any data-related tags. These tags typically contain the numerical data used in Mathcad worksheets.

If you need further assistance with a specific part of the file, feel free to ask!
```

*can you make sense of the algorithm in this worksheet ?*

```
Yes, I can help explain the algorithm used in the worksheet based on the provided XML content. Here is a breakdown of the key parts of the algorithm in the `worksheet.xml`:

### 1. Initial Definitions
The worksheet starts with initial definitions and setup, such as defining the origin:

\```xml
<ws:math region-id="1" top="131.76405200199503" left="3.7795275590551185" width="151.1152416356877" height="25.499999999999993" xmlns:ws="http://schemas.mathsoft.com/worksheet50" xmlns:ml="http://schemas.mathsoft.com/math50">
    <ws:mathrow>
        <ws:eq>
            <ws:ci>ORIGIN</ws:ci>
            <ws:cn>0</ws:cn>
        </ws:eq>
    </ws:mathrow>
</ws:math>
\```

### 2. Data Extraction
Data is extracted from an embedded Excel component. The variables `depth`, `inc`, and `Azimuth` are defined using matrix columns from `data`:

\```xml

### Summary of the Algorithm
1. **Initialization**: Define constants and import data.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant columns from the data matrix (`depth`, `inc`, `Azimuth`).
3. **Function Definitions**: Define functions to calculate distances and positions.
4. **Coordinate Calculations**: Calculate x and y coordinates using the defined functions and survey data.

This algorithm processes wellbore survey data to compute positions based on depth, inclination, and azimuth, visualizing the wellbore path.

If you have specific questions about any part of the algorithm or need further details, feel free to ask!
```

*can you convert following calculations into python functions respectively ? <br>- X and Y Coordinate Calculations <br>- Distance Calculation*

```
Sure, I can help you convert the given Mathcad calculations into Python functions.

### Distance Calculation

The distance calculation in Mathcad is given by the `dist` function. In Python, this can be represented using the `numpy` library for handling arrays and mathematical operations:

```python
import numpy as np

def dist(depth):
    # Calculate distance based on depth and inclination
    return np.sqrt(depth[1:]**2 + depth[:-1]**2)
\```

### X and Y Coordinate Calculations

The X and Y coordinate calculations use the `dist` function, azimuth, and inclination:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_coordinates(depth, inc, azimuth):
    # Calculate distances
    distances = dist(depth)
    
    # Calculate x and y coordinates
    x = distances * np.cos(np.radians(azimuth))
    y = distances * np.sin(np.radians(azimuth))
    
    return x, y

# Example usage
depth = np.array([0, 100, 200, 300])
inc = np.array([0, 10, 20, 30])
azimuth = np.array([0, 90, 180, 270])

x, y = calculate_coordinates(depth, inc, azimuth)
print("X coordinates:", x)
print("Y coordinates:", y)
\```

Here, `depth`, `inc`, and `azimuth` are expected to be numpy arrays containing the respective data. The `calculate_coordinates` function first calculates the distances using the `dist` function and then computes the x and y coordinates.

If you have specific data you'd like to use, you can replace the example arrays with your actual data. If you need further adjustments or have any questions, feel free to ask!
