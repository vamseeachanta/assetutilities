A semisubmersible drilling vessel is being considered for simultaneous drilling and production activities at a 6000 ft water depth offshore Gulf of Mexico.
To determine the feasiblity of the system, Mooring and Riser Analysis is conducted as follows:
*Subsection
- Determine the mooring configuration to limit the vessel offset to 4% of water depth with all moorings intact
- Determine the tensioner stroke requirements for 100 year and 1000 year return period hurricane conditions.
- Determine the riser response and impact of vessel due to tensioner bottom out (riser hitting downstop) and riser slack (Riser hitting upstop)
