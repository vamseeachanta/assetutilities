		<h3>2.1 Mooring Analysis</h3>
		
		<p style="margin-left:32px;">Mooring analysis is conducted using 8 point and 12 point moorings for 100 year and 1000 year hurricane conditions.</p>
            
           <p> A 16 point mooring is anticiated to be required to help restrict the vessel offset to 4% offset in 1000 year return period hurricane condition.</p>

		  <h3>2.2 Riser Analysis</h3>
        <p>Coupled riser analysis is conducted for 1000 year return period hurricane conditions.</p>
		<p>The key analysis assumptions for the riser analysis are: </p>
		
		<ul class="hst">

            <li>Coupled analysis is conducted using simulated load Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) so as to take advantage of the decreased vessel motion due to riser stretch forces. Only 2 risers are assumed to be connected to the semi-submersible.</li>
            <li>The semi-submersible vessel load RAOs is evaluated as described in Analysis Methodology section.</li>
            <li>The tensioner design stroke range is assumed to be 40 ft with 10 ft allocated for upstroke and 30 ft for downstroke.</li>

        </ul>

       

        <p>The key riser analysis findings are summarized below:</p>

        <ul class="hst">

            <li>The riser tension range in 1000 year hurricane condition due to stretch and slack of riser is 1800 kips and 350 kips respectively.</li>
            <li>With 2 risers connected, the max stretch stress (at 20 m below tension application point) is 80 ksi while the max slack stress (at bottom) is 60 ksi.</li>
            <li>When 2 risers are connected to the semi-submersible in 1000 year hurricane conditions, the vessel heave range is decreased by 20% due to the enhanced riser stretch forces </li>
            <li>The riser tension and thus the associated stress is expected to decrease further with 4 risers connected. However analysis is required to determine the riser response, vessel responses and airgap requirements for all possible configurations and loading conditions.</li>
