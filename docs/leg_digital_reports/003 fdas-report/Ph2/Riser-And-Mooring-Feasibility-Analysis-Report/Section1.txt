A semisubmersible drilling vessel is being considered for simultaneous drilling and production activities at a 6000 ft water depth offshore Gulf of Mexico.
To determine the feasiblity of the system, Mooring and Riser Analysis is conducted as follows:
*Subsection
- Determine the mooring configuration to limit the vessel offset to 4% of water depth with all moorings intact
- Determine the tensioner stroke requirements for 100 year and 1000 year return period hurricane conditions.
- Determine the riser response and impact of vessel due to tensioner bottom out (riser hitting downstop) and riser slack (Riser hitting upstop)



The wave, wind and currents are applied in 45 deg direction to the vessel. The offset positions of the vessel with the 8 point mooring and 12 point mooring are shown in the Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively. With the 12 point mooring the vessel is at offset of 4.1% of the water depth. The effective tension of 8 point mooring for mooring lines 1 and 6 are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. The effective tension of 12 point mooring lines 1 and 8 are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9.
