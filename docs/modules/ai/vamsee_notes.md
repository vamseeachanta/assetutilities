- Utilize a framework with gaurdrails and best practices. An example is below:
  - https://github.com/vamseeachanta/assetutilities/blob/main/.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-agent-os-integration/spec.md
  - Add universal work principles to all future specs. See the prompt in link above
  -  Agent guidance:
    -  The biggest swiss knife is "iterate". An powerful example planning workflow is below
      -  add "prompt for future use" to spec. 
      -  Edit the prompt in the spec document 
      -  iterate on the updated spec
      -  Do the iterations in the planning stage (spec document) so the rest of the process can be delegated to AI agents (general-purpose or subject-matter-expert agents).
      -  Leave the choice of the agents to the AI. If they are not chosen right, edit sub-agents responsibility appropriately using additional prompts
    -  Provide clear instructions for AI interactions.
    -  Define expected outcomes for each task.
- Use simplest AI tool to learn how to use the AI:
  - A autocomplete to code generating Copilot journey over last 5 years has been crucial for AI upskilling.
- Make below AI assets AI friendly and portable (across systems, users, and teams):
  - prompts
    - https://github.com/vamseeachanta/assetutilities/blob/main/.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-agent-os-integration/spec.md#executive-summary
  - general or program specific input files in ascii formats
    - md (the new all in one format)
    - Other formats yaml, json, csv, etc. For example, my fea files are yaml (OrcaFlex) or text based (ANSYS).
    - mermaid flowcharts to interchange between text and flowcharts with an AI agent.
    - Ensure compatibility across different platforms, tools, users (team mates, AI agents, personas etc.).
  - Bash scripts applicable to any OS
   - rather than powershell or dos commands.
- Let AI be the fisherman not the fish:
  - Only use prompt curation. 
    - Even better use your voice (and minor keyboard).
    - You can do your chores while AI does the work.
  - AI should go from prompt -> plan -> tasks -> code -> output -> tests -> documentation -> feedback loop.
  - Ensure continuous improvement through regular feedback and iteration
- Follow a repository/project structure and enforce with spartan discipline across your teams:
  - Use a standard structure for all AI projects to ensure consistency, ease of navigation, future use etc..
