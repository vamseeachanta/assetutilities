- Review: Analyze code for potential improvements or errors.

## Bash commands
- npm run build: Build the project
- npm run typecheck: Run the typechecker

## Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

## Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when youâ€™re done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
