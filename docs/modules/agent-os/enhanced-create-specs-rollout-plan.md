## Technical Deployment

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Storage**: No additional requirements (file-based system)
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies already available in AssetUtilities
- **Monitoring**: File-based logging and metrics collection
- **Backup**: Git-based version control provides rollback capability

### Deployment Steps
1. **Verify Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Enhanced instructions already deployed
   ls .agent-os/instructions/enhanced-*
   
   # Cross-repository configuration available
   ls .agent-os/cross-repo-config.yaml
   ```

2. **Update Project Templates**
   ```bash
   # CLAUDE.md templates updated
   grep -r "enhanced" CLAUDE.md
   
   # User guides available
   ls docs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-*
   ```

3. **Enable Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Usage tracking via file system metrics
   # Performance monitoring via test suite
   # Error monitoring via log analysis
   ```

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. **Immediate**: Users can continue with traditional workflows (no disruption)
2. **Selective**: Disable enhanced features for specific users via preferences
3. **Complete**: Remove enhanced instruction files (preserves all data)
