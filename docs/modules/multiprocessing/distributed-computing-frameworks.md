# Distributed Computing Frameworks

> **Category:** Multi-Machine Parallelization  
> **Research Status:** Template Created  
> **Target Audience:** Data engineers and developers scaling beyond single machines

## Overview

[To be completed: Overview of distributed computing frameworks for Python]

## Research Framework

Each framework will be evaluated using our standard criteria:
- **Overview** - Purpose, key features, and target use cases
- **Architecture** - Task organization and execution model
- **Scalability** - Single machine vs distributed capabilities
- **Integration** - Python ecosystem and AssetUtilities compatibility
- **Learning Curve** - Implementation complexity and documentation quality
- **Performance** - Overhead, throughput, and latency characteristics
- **Use Case Fit** - Suitability for business automation and data processing
