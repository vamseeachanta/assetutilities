## Rating System

### Quantitative Ratings (1-5 Scale)
- **5 (Excellent)**: Outstanding performance/suitability, best-in-class
- **4 (Good)**: Strong performance/suitability, recommended option
- **3 (Fair)**: Adequate performance/suitability, viable option with trade-offs
- **2 (Poor)**: Limited performance/suitability, significant limitations
- **1 (Unsuitable)**: Not recommended, fundamental issues or incompatibilities
