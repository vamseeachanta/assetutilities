## Cross-Repository Integration

This repository is integrated with the AssetUtilities hub for shared components:

```yaml
# Reference shared components
@assetutilities:src/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs/
```

## Creating New Specs

Use the enhanced create-specs workflow with template variants:

```bash
# Enhanced spec with all features
/create-spec feature-name module-name enhanced

# API-focused development  
/create-spec api-endpoints services api_focused

# Minimal spec for simple changes
/create-spec bug-fix utils minimal

# Research and investigation
/create-spec performance-study optimization research
```

**Available Templates:**
- `minimal`: Bug fixes, simple changes (4 sections)
- `standard`: Traditional Agent OS specs (5 sections) 
- `enhanced`: Complex features with diagrams and summaries (8+ sections)
- `api_focused`: API development and service integration
- `research`: Exploratory work and proof of concepts

**Documentation:**
- [User Guide](agent-os/enhanced-create-specs-user-guide.md) - Complete usage documentation
- [Setup Guide](agent-os/enhanced-create-specs-setup.md) - Installation and configuration

## AI Persistence

The AI context is stored in `.agent-os/context/` and shared with the team through version control.
