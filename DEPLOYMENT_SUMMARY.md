### 🎨 Template Variants
```bash
# Choose the right template for your needs
/create-spec bug-fix utils minimal           # Simple changes
/create-spec user-api services api_focused   # API development
/create-spec perf-study optimization research # Research work
```

### 🔗 Cross-Repository Integration
```bash
# Reference shared components from AssetUtilities hub
@assetutilities:src/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs/
@assetutilities:agents/registry/sub-agents/workflow-automation
```

### 🔄 Enhanced Task Execution
- Real-time task summary updates
- Performance metrics collection

- Existing specs remain fully functional
- Zero breaking changes introduced

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
Users in any repository can now use enhanced features:

```bash
# Traditional workflow (still works)
/create-spec my-feature

# Enhanced workflow (new capability)
/create-spec my-feature my-module enhanced
```

### Documentation Access
Every repository now has local access to:
- Migration guide: `docs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs-migration-guide.md`
- User guide: `docs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs-user-guide.md`
- Troubleshooting: `docs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs-troubleshooting.md`

## Verification Results

### File Deployment
- **Enhanced Instruction Files**: 26 files deployed (100% success)
- **Documentation Files**: 100+ files deployed (100% success)
- **CLAUDE.md Updates**: 25 files updated (100% success)

### Content Verification
