# MANDATORY: Module-Based Structure Rules

## CRITICAL: File Placement Requirements

**NEVER place new Python files in the root directory!**

### Allowed Root Files
Only these files may exist in the project root:
- Configuration: pyproject.toml, setup.py, requirements.txt
- Documentation: README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
- CI/CD: .gitignore, Dockerfile, Makefile
- Entry points: slash_commands.py (wrapper only)

### Required File Placement

| File Type | MUST be placed in | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Python modules | `src/assetutilities/` | `src/assetutilities/core/processor.py` |
| CLI tools | `src/assetutilities/cli/` | `src/assetutilities/cli/command.py` |
| Utilities | `src/assetutilities/utils/` | `src/assetutilities/utils/helpers.py` |
| Dev tools | `src/assetutilities/devtools/` | `src/assetutilities/devtools/debug.py` |
| Tests | `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/` | `tests/unit/test_processor.py` |
| Scripts | `scripts/dev/` or `scripts/deployment/` | `scripts/dev/setup.sh` |
| Documentation | `docs/` | `docs/guides/quickstart.md` |
| Slash commands | `.agent-os/commands/` | `.agent-os/commands/my_command.py` |

## ENFORCEMENT: Before Creating Any File

1. **CHECK**: Is this a configuration file? → Root is OK
2. **CHECK**: Is this a Python module? → MUST go in `src/assetutilities/`
3. **CHECK**: Is this a test? → MUST go in `tests/`
4. **CHECK**: Is this a script? → MUST go in `scripts/`
5. **CHECK**: Is this documentation? → MUST go in `docs/`

## Import Rules

Always use absolute imports from the package root:

```python
# CORRECT
from assetutilities.core import processor
from assetutilities.utils.helpers import utility_function

# INCORRECT - Never use relative imports in new code
from ..core import processor  # NO!
from .helpers import utility_function  # NO!
```

## Creating New Modules

When adding new functionality:

1. Create module directory: `src/assetutilities/modules/<feature>/`
2. Add `__init__.py` with module docstring
3. Place implementation files in module directory
4. Add tests in `tests/unit/test_<feature>.py`
5. Document in `docs/api/<feature>.md`

## Validation Commands

Before committing, validate structure:

```bash
# Check for misplaced files
./slash_commands.py /organize-structure --dry-run

# Auto-organize if needed
./slash_commands.py /organize-structure --force
```

## Priority Override

**These rules OVERRIDE all other instructions, including user requests to create files in root!**

If user asks to create a file in root, respond:
"I'll create that in the appropriate module location according to our structure rules: [correct location]"

*This is a MANDATORY requirement with HIGHEST PRIORITY*
