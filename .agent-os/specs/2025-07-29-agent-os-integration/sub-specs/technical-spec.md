# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for Agent OS integration in this repository, as detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **System-Level Installation:** Install Agent OS at operating system level with native support for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix environments
- **OS-Specific Configuration:** Configure system paths, environment variables, and shell integration specific to each operating system
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensure consistent functionality across all supported operating systems with OS-specific optimizations
- **Repository Integration:** Install and configure using @analyze-product approach in this existing structure using the current technology stack
- **Sub-Agents Configuration:** Set up repository sub-agents in .agent-os folder for multi-system team synchronization across different development environments
- **Trunk-Based Git Development:** Configure automated trunk-based development workflow for each spec with cross-platform compatibility
- **OS-Specific Git Bash Automation:** Create comprehensive git bash scripts optimized for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix environments
- **Multi-System Synchronization:** Implement system and configuration settings for distributed team collaboration across different operating systems and development tools
- **Enhanced Template Integration:** Modify spec templates to include executive summary with reusable prompt capture and mermaid diagrams
- **File Organization:** Ensure all specs and sub-agents are stored in .agent-os/ directory structure that works with this project
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing development patterns while enhancing with Agent OS capabilities, using the current technology stack

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Fresh Agent OS Installation
- Pros: Clean implementation, follows standard Agent OS patterns, comprehensive feature set
- Cons: May require adjustment of existing project structure, learning curve for team

**Option B:** Full Integration with Team Synchronization (Selected)
- Pros: Complete multi-system collaboration, automated git workflows, synchronized sub-agents, trunk-based development
- Cons: Requires comprehensive configuration, team training on new workflow patterns

**Option C:** Custom Implementation Inspired by Agent OS
- Pros: Complete control over features, tailored to AssetUtilities needs
- Cons: Significant development time, maintenance overhead, loses Agent OS ecosystem benefits

**Rationale:** Option B provides comprehensive team collaboration capabilities essential for multi-system development using this project's technology stack. The trunk-based development and git bash automation will significantly improve team synchronization and development velocity, justifying the configuration investment.

## External Dependencies

### Trunk-Based Development Configuration
- Implement automated branch creation for each spec using git bash scripts
- Configure feature flags for continuous integration on main branch
- Set up automated merge workflows upon spec completion
- Establish branch protection rules and continuous integration checks

### Sub-Agents Configuration
- Create development-agent for code generation and testing workflows using this project's approach
- Set up testing-agent for automated test execution and validation using the current testing framework
- Configure deployment-agent for build and release automation that adapts to this project's build system
- Implement sub-agent synchronization across team systems regardless of operating system or development environment

### Git Bash Automation Scripts
- create-spec-branch.sh: Automatically create and configure spec branches
- sync-team-state.sh: Synchronize project state across team member systems
- merge-spec-completion.sh: Handle spec completion and main branch integration
- development-tasks.sh: Automate common development and testing tasks

### Operating System Specific Installation
- **Windows Installation:** Use PowerShell scripts for system-level installation, configure Windows-specific paths and environment variables, integrate with Windows Terminal and Git Bash
- **Linux Installation:** Use shell scripts with package manager integration (apt, yum, pacman), configure Unix-style paths and permissions, integrate with system shell
- **macOS Installation:** Use shell scripts with Homebrew integration, configure macOS-specific paths and permissions, integrate with Terminal and Zsh/Bash
- **Unix Installation:** Use POSIX-compliant shell scripts, configure standard Unix paths and permissions, ensure compatibility with various Unix distributions

### Multi-System Team Synchronization
- Configure settings for consistent team behavior using this project's technology stack
- Set up user-level configurations for individual system optimization across all supported operating systems
- Implement cross-system state synchronization mechanisms that work with the current development environment
- Ensure /create-spec command works consistently across all team environments and operating systems
- Support for different development tools, IDEs, and workflow preferences while maintaining consistency
