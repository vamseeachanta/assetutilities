# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Task Parallelization and Multiprocessing Research
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Conduct comprehensive research on high-level methods for task parallelization and collation of findings, covering single computer and distributed infrastructure approaches for both in-house and cloud environments. Create detailed documentation with findings categorized by leading tools and frameworks to enhance AssetUtilities' future batch processing and performance optimization capabilities.

## User Stories

### Research Documentation

As a **Python Developer**, I want comprehensive research on task parallelization methods, so that I can make informed decisions about implementing parallel processing in business automation workflows.

This story involves researching and documenting various parallelization approaches from single-threaded Python multiprocessing to distributed computing frameworks like Ray and Airflow. The research should provide practical guidance on when to use each approach, implementation complexity, and performance characteristics for typical business data processing scenarios.

### Framework Comparison 

As a **Data Engineer**, I want detailed comparisons between different parallelization frameworks, so that I can select the most appropriate tool for different use cases and infrastructure constraints.

This involves creating comparison tables and analysis covering Ray from Anyscale, Apache Airflow, Python's multiprocessing library, and other relevant frameworks, examining factors like ease of use, scalability, cloud integration, and suitability for business workflows.

### Implementation Guidance

As a **Business Automation Engineer**, I want practical implementation guidance and examples, so that I can effectively integrate parallelization capabilities into existing business automation tools.

This includes providing code examples, best practices, and integration patterns that align with AssetUtilities' existing architecture and business-focused design philosophy.

## Spec Scope

1. **Single Computer Parallelization** - Research and document local multiprocessing approaches including Python's multiprocessing library, concurrent.futures, and threading
2. **Distributed Computing Frameworks** - Comprehensive analysis of Ray, Dask, Celery, and similar distributed processing frameworks
3. **Workflow Orchestration Tools** - Investigation of Apache Airflow, Prefect, and other workflow management systems
4. **Cloud Infrastructure Solutions** - Research AWS Batch, Google Cloud Dataflow, Azure Batch, and cloud-native parallelization services
5. **Performance and Scalability Analysis** - Comparative analysis of different approaches for varying data sizes and computational complexity
6. **Integration Recommendations** - Specific guidance for incorporating findings into AssetUtilities' existing architecture

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of actual parallelization features (this is research only)
- Benchmarking or performance testing of frameworks
- Deep technical implementation details beyond architectural overview
- Framework-specific tutorials or extensive code examples

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Comprehensive Research Documentation** - Well-structured markdown files in docs/modules/multiprocessing/ covering all researched topics
2. **Framework Comparison Tables** - Detailed comparison matrices showing strengths, weaknesses, use cases, and technical requirements
3. **Implementation Roadmap** - Strategic recommendations for future AssetUtilities parallelization development priorities
