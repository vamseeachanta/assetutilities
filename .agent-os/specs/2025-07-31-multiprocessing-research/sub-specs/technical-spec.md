### Comparison Framework
Each framework analysis will include:
- **Overview**: Purpose, key features, and target use cases
- **Architecture**: How the framework organizes and executes parallel tasks
- **Scalability**: Single machine vs distributed capabilities
- **Integration**: Compatibility with Python ecosystem and AssetUtilities
- **Learning Curve**: Implementation complexity and documentation quality
- **Performance**: Overhead, throughput, and latency characteristics
- **Use Case Fit**: Suitability for business automation and data processing

## External Dependencies

- **Research Sources**: Official documentation, GitHub repositories, academic papers, and industry reports
- **Documentation Tools**: Standard markdown with potential PlantUML diagrams for architecture visualization
- **No Code Dependencies**: This is purely research and documentation effort

## Approach Options

**Option A: Sequential Research** 
- Pros: Thorough investigation of each category, comprehensive coverage
- Cons: Time-intensive, potential for analysis paralysis

**Option B: Parallel Category Research** (Selected)
- Pros: Faster completion, allows for cross-category insights during research
- Cons: May require some rework if categories overlap significantly

**Rationale:** Option B allows for more efficient research by investigating multiple categories simultaneously and identifying cross-cutting themes and integration opportunities as they emerge.

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All technical claims must be supported by official documentation or reputable sources
- **Completeness**: Each framework must be evaluated against the standard comparison criteria
- **Clarity**: Documentation must be accessible to Python developers with varying levels of parallel processing experience
- **Actionability**: Research must conclude with specific recommendations for AssetUtilities development priorities
