## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**validate_environment()**
- Test git repository detection (valid repo, not a repo, bare repo)
- Test GitHub CLI availability and authentication
- Test branch permissions and remote access
- Test clean working directory validation

**analyze_changes()**
- Test file change detection (modified, added, deleted files)
- Test change summary generation for different file types
- Test branch name generation from changes
- Test handling of empty changes

**create_feature_branch()**
- Test branch creation from main branch
- Test branch creation from master branch
- Test handling of existing branch names (conflict resolution)
- Test branch creation failure scenarios

**stage_and_commit()**
- Test staging of modified files
- Test staging of new files
- Test commit message generation
- Test handling of no changes to commit

**push_and_create_pr()**
- Test branch push to remote
- Test PR creation with generated title and description
- Test handling of existing PRs for branch
- Test PR creation failure scenarios

**validate_and_merge()**
- Test merge validation checks
- Test successful merge to main/master
- Test merge conflict detection
- Test failed validation handling

**cleanup_branch()**
- Test local branch deletion
- Test remote branch deletion
- Test handling of branch deletion failures

### Integration Tests

**Full Workflow - Happy Path**
- Create test repository with sample changes
- Execute complete workflow from changes to merged PR
- Verify all intermediate states and final result
- Validate branch cleanup and repository state

**Full Workflow - Conflict Scenarios**
- Test workflow with merge conflicts
- Test workflow with failed validation checks
- Test workflow with network failures
- Verify proper rollback and error reporting

**Edge Cases**
- Test with no changes in repository
- Test with only ignored files changed
- Test with binary files
- Test with very large changesets

### Mocking Requirements

- **GitHub API:** Mock PR creation and merge operations for testing without network calls
- **Git Commands:** Mock git operations to test error scenarios without corrupting test repository
- **File System:** Mock file operations to test different change scenarios consistently
