# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Git Sub-Agent for Trunk-Based Development
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a Git sub-agent bash script that automates trunk-based development workflows by handling branch creation, change staging, commit creation, pull request management, and automated merging to the main branch with proper validation and safety checks.

## User Stories

### Automated Git Workflow for Developers

As a developer working on AssetUtilities, I want to execute a single command that handles the entire git workflow from current changes to merged PR, so that I can focus on development while ensuring consistent trunk-based development practices.

The workflow should automatically detect current repository state, create appropriate feature branches, stage changes, create meaningful commit messages, push to remote, create pull requests with proper descriptions, and merge to main/master after validation checks pass.

### Safe Trunk-Based Development Automation

As a project maintainer, I want the git sub-agent to enforce trunk-based development principles with safety validations, so that code quality is maintained while enabling rapid development cycles.

The system should validate that changes are ready for integration, run appropriate checks before merging, and provide rollback capabilities if issues are detected during the automated process.

## Spec Scope

1. **Branch Management** - Automatic creation of feature branches from main/master with descriptive naming
2. **Change Detection** - Intelligent detection and staging of modified, added, and deleted files
3. **Commit Automation** - Generation of meaningful commit messages based on change analysis
4. **PR Creation** - Automated pull request creation with proper titles and descriptions
5. **Merge Automation** - Safe merging to main/master with validation checks and cleanup

## Out of Scope

- Complex merge conflict resolution (will fail gracefully and require manual intervention)
- Multi-repository operations or submodule management
- Integration with specific CI/CD platforms beyond basic validation
- Code review approval automation (maintains human oversight requirement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A bash script that can be executed from any Git repository to perform the complete trunk-based workflow
2. The script successfully creates branches, commits changes, creates PRs, and merges to main with proper error handling
3. Validation checks ensure code quality and repository safety before automated operations
