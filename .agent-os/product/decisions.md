## 2025-07-23: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

AssetUtilities will focus on providing a comprehensive Python utility library for developers and data professionals, covering Excel processing, data visualization, file management, web scraping, and report generation with emphasis on business workflow automation.

### Context

Analysis of the existing codebase revealed a mature utility library with extensive functionality already implemented. The product serves as a foundational library used by several other subject-specific libraries for development, indicating strong existing adoption and proven value.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Specialized Single-Purpose Libraries**
   - Pros: Focused functionality, smaller package size, clearer scope
   - Cons: Users need multiple dependencies, integration complexity, fragmented ecosystem

2. **Enterprise SaaS Platform**
   - Pros: Recurring revenue, cloud-based scaling, user-friendly interface
   - Cons: Requires infrastructure investment, loses Python-native integration, deployment complexity

3. **Framework-Specific Extensions**
   - Pros: Deep integration with specific frameworks, targeted user base
   - Cons: Limited market reach, framework dependency risks, reduced flexibility

### Rationale

The comprehensive utility library approach was chosen because:

- **Proven Market Demand:** Existing implementation shows strong adoption across multiple dependent projects
- **Developer Efficiency:** Integrated utilities reduce boilerplate code and improve development velocity
- **Business Focus:** Unlike generic data science libraries, utilities are designed for practical business workflows
- **Python Ecosystem Gap:** No existing comprehensive library addresses the full spectrum of business automation utilities

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development cycles for business automation projects
- Consistent APIs across different utility types (Excel, visualization, files)
- Reduced dependency management overhead for downstream projects
- Strong foundation for building specialized business applications
- Clear differentiation from both generic libraries and enterprise platforms

**Negative:**
- Larger package size due to comprehensive functionality
- More complex testing and maintenance due to broad scope
- Potential feature creep if not carefully managed
- Risk of becoming too generic if business focus is lost

## 2025-07-23: Python-First Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

AssetUtilities will maintain a Python-first architecture with setuptools-based packaging, supporting Python 3.8+ with extensive third-party library integration rather than implementing functionality from scratch.

### Context

The existing codebase demonstrates successful integration of specialized libraries (Plotly, matplotlib, openpyxl, BeautifulSoup, etc.) rather than reimplementing functionality. This approach leverages the Python ecosystem effectively while providing unified interfaces.

### Rationale

- **Ecosystem Leverage:** Python has mature libraries for each utility domain
- **Maintenance Efficiency:** Focus on integration rather than re-implementation
- **Community Benefits:** Users can leverage existing knowledge of underlying libraries
- **Rapid Development:** Faster feature delivery through library composition

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development and feature delivery
- Lower maintenance burden through dependency management
- Access to battle-tested, optimized implementations
- Community familiarity with underlying tools

**Negative:**
- Dependency management complexity
- Potential version conflicts between libraries
- Less control over underlying functionality
- Larger installation footprint

## 2025-07-23: Business Workflow Focus Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Business Stakeholders

### Decision

AssetUtilities will prioritize business workflow automation over pure data science capabilities, focusing on practical utilities that solve common business problems like report generation, Excel processing, and document automation.

### Context

Analysis of existing modules shows strong emphasis on business document formats (Excel, Word, PDF), reporting capabilities, and workflow automation rather than advanced statistical or machine learning capabilities.

### Rationale

- **Market Differentiation:** Clear distinction from data science libraries like pandas, scikit-learn
- **User Base Clarity:** Targets business developers rather than data scientists
- **Practical Value:** Solves immediate productivity problems for business users
- **Sustainable Development:** Focused scope prevents feature creep

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product positioning and marketing message
- Focused development efforts on high-impact business utilities
- Strong value proposition for business application developers
- Reduced competition with specialized data science tools

**Negative:**
- May exclude some potential users in pure data science roles
- Could limit expansion into AI/ML acceleration markets
- Requires discipline to avoid feature scope expansion
- May need separate products for advanced analytics needs
