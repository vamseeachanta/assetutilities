# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Git Bash Development Environment Setup
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish Git Bash as the primary terminal and console environment for the AssetUtilities Python project, providing automated setup, customizations, and best practices that work efficiently for developers with 1-2 years of Git Bash experience.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the git bash development setup spec to include:
- New terminal customizations and aliases
- Additional development tool integrations
- Environment variable configurations
- Performance optimizations
Maintain compatibility with Windows Git Bash and preserve the project-specific override approach.
```

## User Stories

### Developer Onboarding Story

As a new developer joining the AssetUtilities project, I want to quickly set up a standardized Git Bash environment, so that I can be productive immediately without spending hours configuring terminal settings and development tools.

The workflow includes cloning the repository, running a single setup script, and having Git Bash configured with project-specific aliases, environment variables, Python path settings, and common development shortcuts that override any local PC defaults.

### Experienced Developer Story

As an experienced developer working on AssetUtilities, I want consistent terminal behavior across different machines, so that my development workflow remains efficient regardless of which workstation I'm using.

The system should provide standardized aliases for common tasks like running tests, building packages, managing virtual environments, and Git operations specific to this project's needs.

### Team Consistency Story

As a team lead, I want all developers using the same terminal environment and shortcuts, so that documentation, pair programming, and troubleshooting are consistent across the team.

The setup should ensure that project-specific configurations take precedence over individual developer preferences while still allowing personal customizations that don't conflict with project requirements.

## Spec Scope

1. **Project-Specific Bash Configuration** - Repository-based .bashrc and profile settings that override local defaults
2. **Development Aliases and Functions** - Common shortcuts for Python development, testing, and package management
3. **Environment Variable Management** - Automated setup of Python paths, virtual environments, and project-specific variables
4. **Git Bash Optimization** - Performance tweaks and customizations specific to Windows Git Bash
5. **Setup Automation** - Single-command installation script for new developer onboarding

## Out of Scope

- PowerShell or Command Prompt configurations
- IDE-specific terminal integrations (VS Code, PyCharm)
- Docker or containerized development environments
- Cross-platform shell configurations (macOS/Linux-specific setups)
- Advanced terminal multiplexers (tmux, screen)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Automated Setup Experience** - New developers can run one command to configure Git Bash for this project
2. **Consistent Development Environment** - All team members have identical terminal aliases and shortcuts
3. **Project-Override Capability** - Repository settings take precedence over local Git Bash configurations
