# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-git-bash-development-setup/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Setup Script (setup-gitbash.sh)**
- Test backup creation of existing .bashrc
- Test project configuration injection
- Test error handling for permission issues
- Test detection of existing project configuration

**Environment Loader (dev-env.sh)**
- Test project directory detection
- Test virtual environment activation
- Test environment variable setting
- Test alias loading functionality

**Alias Definitions (aliases.sh)**
- Test alias functionality and command execution
- Test parameter passing to aliased commands
- Test conflict resolution with existing aliases

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Setup Process**
- Fresh Git Bash installation to fully configured environment
- Setup script execution with various starting configurations
- Project configuration loading in different directory contexts

**Cross-Session Persistence**
- Configuration survives Git Bash restart
- Settings persist across different project directories
- Proper cleanup when leaving project directory

**Multi-Project Compatibility**
- Multiple projects with different configurations
- Switching between projects with different requirements
- No interference between project-specific settings

### Mocking Requirements

- **File System Operations:** Mock file creation, modification, and backup operations
- **Git Bash Environment:** Mock different Git Bash installation scenarios
- **Python Environment:** Mock virtual environment detection and activation
- **Command Execution:** Mock shell command results for testing aliases

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Fresh Developer Onboarding
1. New Windows machine with Git for Windows installed
2. Clone AssetUtilities repository
3. Run setup script
4. Verify all aliases and environment variables work correctly
5. Restart Git Bash and verify persistence

### Existing Developer Migration
1. Developer with existing .bashrc customizations
2. Run setup script
3. Verify existing customizations preserved
4. Verify project settings take precedence
5. Test switching between projects

### Error Recovery Testing
1. Interrupted setup process
2. Corrupted configuration files
3. Permission denied scenarios
4. Network connectivity issues during setup

## Performance Testing

### Startup Time Benchmarks
- Measure Git Bash startup time before and after configuration
- Target: Less than 500ms additional startup time
- Test with various project sizes and configurations

### Command Execution Performance
- Benchmark alias execution speed
- Test environment variable lookup performance
- Verify no significant slowdown in common operations

## Documentation Testing

### User Guide Validation
- Follow setup instructions exactly as written
- Test with developers of 1-2 years experience level
- Verify troubleshooting sections address common issues
- Validate alternative tool recommendations

### Knowledge Transfer Testing
- New developer can complete setup without assistance
- Common customization tasks documented adequately
- Alternative approaches clearly explained
