# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-01-git-sub-agent/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-01
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Bash Compatibility:** Script must work on Linux/macOS with bash 4.0+
- **Git Integration:** Utilize git CLI commands with proper error handling and validation
- **GitHub CLI Integration:** Use `gh` command for PR creation and management
- **Repository State Detection:** Analyze current branch, uncommitted changes, and remote status
- **Branch Naming Convention:** Generate meaningful branch names based on change analysis
- **Commit Message Generation:** Create conventional commit messages from file changes
- **PR Description Template:** Auto-generate PR descriptions with change summaries
- **Merge Validation:** Verify tests pass and conflicts are resolved before merging
- **Cleanup Operations:** Remove feature branches after successful merge
- **Error Recovery:** Provide rollback capabilities and clear error messages

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Single Monolithic Script
- Pros: Self-contained, easy deployment, no dependencies
- Cons: Complex to maintain, harder to test individual components

**Option B:** Modular Script with Functions (Selected)
- Pros: Maintainable, testable functions, clear separation of concerns
- Cons: Slightly more complex structure

**Option C:** Multi-file Script System
- Pros: Clean separation, reusable components
- Cons: Deployment complexity, multiple files to manage

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of maintainability and simplicity, allowing for clear function separation while keeping everything in a single deployable script.

## External Dependencies

- **git** - Version control operations (assumed installed)
- **gh** - GitHub CLI for PR operations
- **Justification:** GitHub CLI provides robust PR management capabilities and is the standard tool for GitHub automation

## Script Architecture

### Core Functions

1. **validate_environment()** - Check git repo, gh CLI, and permissions
2. **analyze_changes()** - Detect modified files and generate change summary
3. **create_feature_branch()** - Generate branch name and create from main/master
4. **stage_and_commit()** - Add changes and create commit with generated message
5. **push_and_create_pr()** - Push branch and create PR with description
6. **validate_and_merge()** - Run checks and merge to main/master
7. **cleanup_branch()** - Remove feature branch after successful merge

### Error Handling Strategy

- Exit codes for different failure types
- Rollback functions for partial operations
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Safe defaults that prevent destructive actions

### Configuration Options

- Branch naming patterns
- Commit message templates
- PR description templates
- Validation check customization
