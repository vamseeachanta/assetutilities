## Overview

Integrate Agent OS development framework into this repository to enable multi-system team collaboration with trunk-based development, automated git bash workflows, and synchronized sub-agents. This integration will provide structured spec creation, task management, and standardized documentation processes optimized for distributed team environments using this project's existing technology stack.

## User Stories

### Multi-System Development Team Collaboration

As a developer working on this project across multiple systems, I want to use Agent OS with trunk-based development and automated git bash scripts, so that I can collaborate seamlessly with team members while maintaining consistent workflows and synchronized states using our existing technology stack.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer creates new spec using `/create-spec` command
2. The system automatically creates trunk-based git branch for this spec
3. Sub-agents are configured in .agent-os folder for team synchronization
4. Git bash scripts automate development tasks and execution
5. All team members work on main branch with feature flags and continuous integration
6. Spec completion automatically merges changes and updates the state

### System-Level Agent OS Installation

As a team member setting up this project on my system, I want Agent OS to be properly installed at the system level for my operating system, so that I can use the framework consistently regardless of whether I'm on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unix, with all commands and tools properly configured for my environment.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System detects current operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix)
2. Downloads and installs appropriate Agent OS system components for the OS
3. Configures system-level paths, environment variables, and shell integration
4. Sets up OS-specific git bash environment and permissions
5. Validates installation with cross-platform compatibility tests
6. Enables seamless `/create-spec` and other Agent OS commands across all supported platforms

### Team Synchronization and Management

As a manager of this project, I want Agent OS to provide multi-system synchronization with standardized spec creation, so that distributed team members can work consistently regardless of their development environment while maintaining full traceability of requirements and decisions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Team member creates spec using standardized `/create-spec` process
2. Executive summary captures original prompt for future reference
3. Mermaid flowcharts visualize process flows and system interactions
4. Sub-agents ensure consistent behavior across all team systems
5. Trunk-based development enables continuous integration without branch conflicts
6. Git bash automation handles routine development and deployment tasks

## Future Spec Requirements

**Executive Summary Prompt Completeness Standard**: All specs created using Agent OS must include a complete, self-contained "Prompt for Future Reuse" in the executive summary that:
- Contains all necessary information for any project team to implement without external references
- Includes the Task Dependency Ordering Standard as defined below
- Documents all implementation steps with explicit dependencies
- Lists all expected deliverables and outcomes
- Uses generic language (pronouns, common nouns) for repository adaptability
- Provides sufficient context for successful implementation across different environments

**Task Dependency Ordering Standard**: All future specs created using Agent OS must follow the logical dependency ordering principle established in this specification, where:
- Prior tasks are always applicable (if logical) to subsequent tasks
- Each task builds upon the achievements of previous tasks
- Task dependencies are explicitly documented in both the prompt and task sections
- Foundation tasks (like system installation) come before dependent tasks (like analysis or configuration)
- This ordering minimizes errors, reduces rework, and ensures consistent implementation success across different team members and environments
