## Test Coverage

### Documentation Quality Tests

**Research Completeness**
- Verify all required frameworks and tools are documented
- Ensure each framework includes all standard comparison criteria
- Validate that external links to official documentation are functional
- Confirm all comparison tables have consistent structure and data

**Content Accuracy Tests**
- Cross-reference technical claims with official documentation
- Verify version numbers and feature descriptions are current
- Validate code examples (if included) for syntax correctness
- Ensure performance claims are supported by credible sources

### Structural Tests

**Documentation Navigation**
- Test that all internal links between documents work correctly
- Verify table of contents matches actual document structure
- Ensure consistent formatting and markdown syntax across all files
- Validate that directory structure matches technical specification

**Comparison Framework Tests**
- Verify all frameworks are evaluated against the same criteria
- Ensure comparison tables have complete data for each framework
- Test that recommendations are supported by research findings
- Validate scoring or ranking methodologies (if used)

### Integration Tests

**AssetUtilities Alignment**
- Verify recommendations align with existing product architecture
- Ensure suggested approaches are compatible with current tech stack
- Test that business use case examples are relevant to target users
- Validate integration complexity assessments are realistic

### Content Review Tests

**Technical Accuracy Review**
- Expert review of distributed computing framework descriptions
- Validation of cloud service capabilities and limitations
- Review of performance analysis methodology and conclusions
- Assessment of implementation complexity estimates

## Mocking Requirements

- **External Link Validation**: Mock HTTP requests to verify documentation links remain accessible
- **Framework Version Checking**: Mock API calls to check for framework version updates
- **Performance Data Validation**: Mock data sources for performance benchmarking claims
