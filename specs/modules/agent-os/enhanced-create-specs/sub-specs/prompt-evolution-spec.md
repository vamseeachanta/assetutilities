# Prompt Evolution Tracking Specification

This is the prompt evolution tracking specification for the enhanced create-specs system detailed in @specs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-02
> Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

Implement a dynamic prompt evolution tracking system that captures and maintains iterative prompt refinements as users provide additional context and fine-tuning during spec development, creating a living record of requirement clarifications that can inform future similar specs.

## Technical Requirements

### Prompt Summary Structure

The prompt summary section in each spec should evolve to include:

```markdown
## Prompt Summary

**Original Request:** [Initial user prompt that triggered spec creation]

**Context Provided:** [Background information and assumptions provided by user]

**Iterative Refinements:**
- **[Date] - Refinement 1:** [Additional prompt/clarification from user]
  - **Impact:** [How this changed the spec understanding]
- **[Date] - Refinement 2:** [Further fine-tuning prompt]
  - **Impact:** [Resulting spec adjustments]

**Clarifications Made:** 
- [List of clarifications resolved during spec development]

**Reuse Notes:** [How this prompt can be adapted for similar future specs]

**Prompt Evolution:** [Summary of how the understanding evolved through user interaction]
```

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initial Capture**
   - Record the original user prompt verbatim
   - Capture any initial context provided
   - Note assumptions made by the AI agent

2. **Iterative Updates**
   - Each time user provides additional context or fine-tuning:
     - Add timestamped entry to "Iterative Refinements"
     - Document the impact on spec understanding
     - Update affected sections of the spec
   - Maintain chronological order of refinements

3. **Impact Analysis**
   - For each refinement, document:
     - What changed in the spec
     - Why the change was needed
     - How it affects implementation

4. **Reusability Enhancement**
   - Extract patterns from prompt evolution
   - Create templates for common refinement types
   - Build knowledge base of prompt patterns

### Storage and Persistence

```yaml
# .agent-os/context/prompt-evolution.yml
prompts:
  - spec_id: "enhanced-create-specs"
    original_prompt: "..."
    refinements:
      - date: "2025-08-02"
        prompt: "also add to this enhancement spec..."
        impact: "Added prompt evolution tracking feature"
        sections_affected:
          - "Spec Scope"
          - "Expected Deliverables"
    patterns_identified:
      - "User often requests iterative improvements"
      - "Fine-tuning typically involves adding missing features"
```

### Cross-Spec Learning

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify common refinement patterns across specs
   - Build library of typical user clarifications
   - Create prompt templates based on successful patterns

2. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Reference similar prompt evolutions from other specs
   - Suggest potential refinements based on past patterns
   - Proactively ask for common clarifications

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Update prompt templates based on evolution patterns
   - Refine initial prompt capture process
   - Improve clarification questions

## Workflow Integration

### During Spec Creation

1. **Initial Prompt Capture**
   ```markdown
   ## Prompt Summary
   **Original Request:** [Captured automatically from user input]
   ```

2. **User Provides Additional Context**
   ```markdown
   **Iterative Refinements:**
   - **[Current Date] - Update 1:** "also add prompt evolution tracking"
     - **Impact:** Added new feature to spec scope
   ```

3. **Spec Sections Updated**
   - Automatically update affected sections
   - Maintain audit trail of changes
   - Link refinements to spec modifications

### Post-Spec Analysis

1. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Analyze completed spec for reusable patterns
   - Update prompt templates library
   - Share learnings across repositories

2. **Template Generation**
   - Create spec templates from successful patterns
   - Build prompt templates for common scenarios
   - Document best practices for prompt refinement

## Benefits

### For Current Spec Development
- Clear audit trail of requirement evolution
- Better understanding of user intent
- Reduced miscommunication and rework

### For Future Spec Creation
- Reusable prompt patterns and templates
- Proactive clarification based on past experiences
- Faster spec development through learned patterns

### For Team Collaboration
- Shared understanding of requirement evolution
- Knowledge transfer between team members
- Consistent spec development practices

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Update Spec Template**
   - Add iterative refinements section to prompt summary
   - Include impact analysis for each refinement
   - Create reusability notes section

2. **Create Tracking System**
   - Implement prompt-evolution.yml structure
   - Build refinement capture mechanism
   - Develop pattern recognition logic

3. **Integrate with Workflow**
   - Update create-spec.md to include evolution tracking
   - Add prompts for capturing refinements
   - Implement automatic section updates

4. **Build Knowledge Base**
   - Create prompt patterns library
   - Develop spec templates from patterns
   - Document best practices

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Living Documentation** - Specs that evolve with user input and maintain complete history
2. **Improved Reusability** - Clear patterns and templates for future similar specs
3. **Better Understanding** - Reduced ambiguity through tracked clarifications
4. **Continuous Learning** - System that improves with each spec created

## Success Metrics

- **Refinement Tracking:** 100% of user refinements captured and documented
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify and document common refinement patterns
- **Reuse Rate:** 50%+ of new specs leverage patterns from previous specs
- **Time Reduction:** 30% faster spec creation through pattern reuse
- **Quality Improvement:** Reduced rework due to better initial understanding

This specification establishes a comprehensive prompt evolution tracking system that transforms spec creation from a static process into a dynamic, learning system that continuously improves through user interaction and pattern recognition.
