## Approach Options

**Option A: Build Custom Platform**
- Pros: Complete control, tailored to specific needs, intellectual property ownership
- Cons: High development cost, longer implementation time, maintenance burden

**Option B: Customize Existing PLM System** (Selected)
- Pros: Faster deployment, proven architecture, vendor support, regular updates
- Cons: Licensing costs, potential customization limitations, vendor lock-in

**Option C: Hybrid Cloud-Native Solution**
- Pros: Scalability, reduced infrastructure costs, modern architecture
- Cons: Data sovereignty concerns, internet dependency, complexity

**Rationale:** Option B selected for faster time-to-market and reduced risk. Recommend Siemens Teamcenter Marine or Dassault 3DEXPERIENCE with naval architecture modules as base platform, supplemented with custom AI components.
